## Overview

**Manual_ML** is a developer-centric tool that simplifies the process of performing manual machine learning workflows through an intuitive, interactive interface.

Built to facilitate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, it empowers developers to experiment efficiently and gain insights quickly.

### Why Manual_ML?

This project aims to streamline ML experimentation and visualization. The core features include:

- üß© **Interactivity**: Leverages Gradio to enable seamless exploration of datasets, models, and results.
- üöÄ **Flexibility**: Supports multiple datasets and machine learning algorithms for versatile experimentation.
- ü§ñ **Automation**: Orchestrates data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation within a cohesive environment.
- üìä **Visualization**: Provides tools for interpreting model performance and understanding data insights.
- üîß **Integration**: Designed for easy incorporation into larger systems, enhancing workflow efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Package Manager**: Conda

---

### Installation

Build `Manual_ML` from source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mah-Metwally/Manual_ML
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Manual_ML
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies using conda:**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f conda.yml
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the project with:

```bash
conda activate {venv}
python {entrypoint}
```

Replace `{venv}` with your environment name and `{entrypoint}` with the Python file that kicks off your app (e.g., `main.py`).

---

## Testing

Manual_ML uses the `{test_framework}` test framework. Run the test suite with:

```bash
conda activate {venv}
pytest
```

Make sure to replace `{test_framework}` with the actual framework (`pytest` is implied).
